0,From Partial to Full Universality: The Family 500+ Programme in Poland and Its Labour Supply Implications,https://cenea.org.pl/2019/12/16/from-partial-to-full-universality-the-family-500-programme-in-poland-and-its-labour-supply-implications/,"The implementation of the ‘Family 500+’ programme in April 2016 represented a significant shift in public support for families with children in Poland. The programme guaranteed 500 PLN/month (approx. 120 euros) for each second and subsequent child in the family and the same amount for the first child in families with incomes below a specified threshold. As of July 2019, the benefit has been made fully universal for all children aged 0-17, an extension which nearly doubled its total cost and benefited primarily middle and higher income households. We examine the labour market implications of both the initial design and its recent fully universal version. Using the discrete choice labour supply model, we show that the initial Family 500+ benefits generated strong labour supply disincentives and were expected to result in the withdrawal of between 160-200 thousand women from the labour market. The recent removal of the means test is likely to nullify this negative effect, leading to an approximately neutral impact on labour supply. We argue that when spending over 4% of GDP on families with children, it should be possible to design a more comprehensive system of support, which would be more effective in reaching the joint objectives of low child poverty and high female employment combined with higher fertility rates.", ,,"

1,Polski Ład: dystrybucyjne konsekwencje propozycji podatkowych Zjednoczonej Prawicy,https://cenea.org.pl/2021/05/19/polski-lad-dystrybucyjne-konsekwencje-propozycji-podatkowych-zjednoczonej-prawicy/,"W Komentarzu CenEA z dnia 19.05.2021 przedstawiono wstępne wyliczenia konsekwencji zmian podatkowych proponowanych w ramach programu „Polski Ład” ogłoszonego przez koalicyjne partie Zjednoczonej Prawicy w sobotę, 15.05.2021. Reforma systemu podatkowego proponowana przez partie Zjednoczonej Prawicy w ramach programu „Polski Ład” stanowić będzie jedną z najistotniejszych zmian w polskim systemie podatkowym wprowadzonych w ciągu ostatnich 30 lat. Według szacunków Ministerstwa Finansów całkowite korzyści netto dla gospodarstw domowych w wyniku reformy wyniosą około 5,1 mld zł rocznie (szacunki Ministerstwa wahają się w granicach 5,1 – 7,0 mld zł rocznie), przy czym bardzo istotnym aspektem proponowanych zmian jest wysoki zakres redystrybucji dochodu.Jednym z najważniejszych elementów ogłoszonych zmian jest propozycja jest rozdzielenie rozliczenia podatku dochodowego i składek zdrowotnych oraz zmiana sposobu naliczania składki zdrowotnej od dochodów z działalności gospodarczej w sektorze pozarolniczym. W tej nowej koncepcji systemu podatkowego podwyższona zostanie kwota wolna od podatku (do 30,000 zł rocznie) i próg podatkowy (do 120,000 zł rocznie). Na proponowanych rozwiązaniach podatkowych 10,9 mln gospodarstw domowych odniesie korzyści powyżej 10 zł miesięcznie, zaś suma tych korzyści sięgnie 28,8 mld zł rocznie. Dla kolejnych 1,5 mln gospodarstw zmiany dochodu w wyniku propozycji będą ograniczone w przedziale od -10 do + 10 zł miesięcznie. 1,0 mln gospodarstw straci od 10 do 250 zł miesięcznie, co daje łączną stratę w wysokości 1,3 mld zł rocznie, a dochody 0,4 mln gospodarstw spadną o więcej niż 250 zł miesięcznie. Te gospodarstwa łączenie stracą aż 22,1 mld zł rocznie.W ujęciu dystrybucyjnym na proponowanych reformach podatkowych przeciętnie najwięcej zyskają gospodarstwa domowe ze środka rozkładu dochodów. Dochody gospodarstw w grupach decylowych 4-6 wzrosną przeciętnie o około 260 zł miesięcznie, podczas gdy gospodarstwa z najniższej grupy dochodowej zyskają przeciętnie 64 zł miesięcznie. Dochody gospodarstw z najwyższej grupy decylowej spadną przeciętnie o 1 390 zł miesięcznie.Jak pokazano w Komentarzu, grupą, która odniesie największe korzyści w wyniku proponowanych zmian w systemie podatkowym są rodziny osób w wieku emerytalnym, których głównym źródłem dochodu są świadczenia emerytalno–rentowe. Dzięki proponowanym zmianom dochody rodzin osób w wieku 60+/65+ wzrosną łącznie o 11,3 mld zł rocznie, co stanowi ponad połowę łącznych kosztów reformy w systemie PIT dla systemu finansów publicznych (jak podaje Ministerstwo Finansów – 21 mld zł rocznie). Problem ubóstwa i wykluczenia osób starszych w Polsce pozostaje nadal poważnym wyzwaniem dla polityki społeczno-gospodarczej. Jednak przy innych równoległych instrumentach wsparcia tej grupy, takich jak trzynasta i czternasta emerytura, należy rozważyć czy w obecnej sytuacji polityka podatkowa nie powinna raczej skupić się na gospodarstwach aktywnych zawodowo, w szczególności tych o niskich dochodach. Tak ukierunkowane reformy powinny łączyć z jednej strony podnoszenie wysokości kosztów uzyskania przychodu, a z drugiej korzystać z istniejących instrumentów umożliwiających zwiększenie dochodów netto za pośrednictwem zwrotnych ulg podatkowych dla pracowników o najniższych dochodach.", ,,"

2,Old-Age Poverty and Health – How Much Does Income Matter?,https://cenea.org.pl/2013/09/01/old-age-poverty-and-health-how-much-does-income-matter/,"The question concerning the material situation of older people and its consequences for their wellbeing seems to be more important than ever. This is especially true given rapid demographic changes in the Western World and economic pressures on governments to reduce public spending. We use data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) to examine different aspects of old-age poverty and its possible effects on deterioration in health. The data contains information on representative samples from 12 European countries including the Czech Republic and Poland. We use the longitudinal dimension of the data to go beyond cross sectional associations and analyze transitions in health status controlling for health in the initial period and material conditions. We find that poverty matters for health outcomes in later life. Wealth-defined and subjective poverty correlates much more strongly with health outcomes than income-defined measure. Importantly subjective poverty significantly increases mortality by 58.3% for those aged 50–64 (for details see Adena and Myck, 2013a and 2013b).", ,,"

Persecution in the Czech Republic had most severe consequences for professional careers of the respondents. The experience of persecution in the Czech Republic has strongest effects on the reported satisfaction with job achievements and career disappointment. The relationship between persecution and health is strongest in Poland, where compared to those not persecuted in the past, the persecuted individuals are from 60-70% more likely to report current poor health, three or more limitations in performing daily activities (ADLs), as well as having experienced long-term illness and a period of disability. Persecuted individuals in Poland are also twice as likely to report having three or more symptoms of poor health. Effects of persecution on health are also present in the Czech and GDR samples, though in most cases the effects are not statistically significant.", ,,"

Family size is instrumented using twinning and gender composition of the first two children. Among families with at least one child we identify the average causal effect of an additional child on mother’s employment to be -7.1 percentage points. However, we find no effect of additional children on female employment among families with two or more kids. Heterogeneity analysis suggests no causal effects of fertility on female employment among mothers with less than college education and older mothers (born before 1978). Furthermore, we find evidence for the interaction of family size with maternal education and age. An unintuitive feature of our finding is that we identify a positive bias of OLS estimates for highly educated mothers and for mothers born after 1977.", ,,"

6,How History Matters for Student Performance. Lessons from the Partitions of Poland,https://cenea.org.pl/2015/03/01/how-history-matters-for-student-performance-lessons-from-the-partitions-of-poland/,"This paper examines the effect on current student performance of the 19th century Partitions of Poland among Austria, Prussia and Russia. Despite the modern similarities of the three regions, using a regression discontinuity design I show that student test scores are 0.6 standard deviation higher on the Austrian side of the former Austrian-Russian border. This magnitude is comparable to the black vs. white test score gap in the US. On the other hand, I do not find evidence for differences on the Prussian-Russian border. Using a theoretical model and indirect evidence I argue that the Partitions have persisted through their impact on social norms toward local schools. Nevertheless, the persistent effect of Austria is puzzling given the historical similarities of the Austrian and Prussian educational systems. I argue that the differential legacy of Austria and Prussia originates from the Austrian Empire’s policy to promote Polish identity in schools and the Prussian Empire’s efforts to Germanize the Poles through education.", ,,"

7,The double burden of paid and unpaid work on women in Poland,https://cenea.org.pl/2021/12/20/the-double-burden-of-paid-and-unpaid-work-on-women-in-poland/,"The vast majority of the Polish population agrees that household duties and childcare activities should be equally shared in a couple. However, in Poland, as in many other countries, the real division of household work and care does not reflect the attitudes towards it. Relying on the information from the Time Budget Survey, in this brief we show that women in Poland spend far more time on household chores and much more often take care of children than men. With relatively high labour market participation rates, and negligible rates of part-time employment, Polish women face the problem of a double burden of paid and unpaid work, commonly pointed out in the literature in the context of the post-communist countries. More equal sharing of domestic work would facilitate greater professional involvement among women and free their time to enjoy more leisure. More active government policies aimed at closing gender gaps along different dimensions could address prevailing constraints as well as social norms and stereotypes, and contribute towards such changes.The full Report is available Reports from Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Latvia, Ukraine and Russia are available in English and the national languages ", ,,"

Since the 25th March 2020, 4.6M students in Poland have been studying remotely, and any decisions on reopening schools or extending the lockdown depend on the course of development of the pandemic. Even at the time of “regular” access to schooling, the discrepancies in living conditions between students, in particular in terms of their housing conditions and household infrastructure, have a substantial impact on the overall quality of learning and educational outcomes, all the more so when students have to switch to distance learning. In the current situation, substandard housing conditions and lack of access to a computer or the Internet can make it difficult or outright impossible for many students to access education in the coming weeks.The full report is available ", ,,"

9,Healthier over time? Period effects in health among older Europeans in a step-wise approach to identification,https://cenea.org.pl/2022/03/11/healthier-over-time-period-effects-in-health-among-older-europeans-in-a-step-wise-approach-to-identification/,"In the paper published recently in Social Science & Medicine Michał Myck and Monika Oczkowska examine changes in the level of physical health using longitudinal data on people aged 50+ from nine European countries covering the years from 2004 to 2017. For this purpose they develop a novel approach to identify age, period and cohort effects, which, in contrast to methods relying on mechanical restrictions, uses a step-wise estimation combining information on physical health with data on cognitive abilities. The approach relies on two important assumptions. First, relative differences between cohorts in cognitive abilities are estimated assuming that only age and cohort effects are responsible for their evolution. The authors then use the estimated proportional cohort differences to restrict the differences between cohorts in health development. The method is applied to the dynamics of four measures of poor health: weak grip strength, limitations in mobility, in activities of daily living (ADL) and in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). The results suggest insignificant or adverse period effects for the evolution of physical health. These estimates, which reflect the implications of time over the period of 14 years, are relatively low, but they highlight the surprising fact that any improvements in health in the examined period have been driven essentially by cohort effects. This evidence is consistent with some earlier studies and sheds new light on recent (pre-pandemic) trends in life expectancy. It also raises questions concerning efficacy of healthcare and equal access to high quality care – the factors one would consider as important determinants of period effects in health.", ,,"

12,Dynamics of Earnings and Hourly Wages in Germany,https://cenea.org.pl/2009/06/01/dynamics-of-earnings-and-hourly-wages-in-germany/,"There is by now a vast number of studies which document a sharp increase in cross-sectional wage inequality during the 2000s. It is often assumed that this inequality is of a “permanent nature” which in turn is used as an argument calling for government intervention. We examine these claims using a fully balanced panel of full-time employed individuals in Germany from the German Socio-Economic Panel for the years 1994-2006. In line with previous studies, our sample shows sharply rising inequality during the2000s. Applying covariance structure models, we calculate the fraction of permanent and transitory wage and earnings inequality. From 1994 on, permanent inequality increases continuously, peaks in 2001 and then declines in subsequent years. Interestingly the decline in the permanent fraction of inequality occurs at the time of most rapid increases in cross-sectional inequality. It seems therefore that it is primarily the temporary and not the permanent component which has driven the strong expansion of cross-sectional inequality during the 2000s in Germany.", ,,"

We study these decisions to identify gender preferences in six Central and Eastern European countries, which vary with respect to their current political and economic conditions, but share a common experience of past communist rule. Using subsamples of census data collected in the IPUMS-International inventory around 2000 and 2010, we examine the effect of the gender of the first-born child(ren) on the fertility and relationship stability of their parents. Only in the case of Romania do our results consistently point towards boy preferences, while in Russia boy preferences can be detected in families with two or more children. Importantly, in four out of six countries (Belarus, Poland, Russia and Ukraine) parents are more likely to have a second child if the first-born was a boy, indicating girl preferences. These preferences could be interpreted as a reflection of concern regarding future care support for parents.", ,,"

In particular, they often imply trade-offs between effects on income redistribution and work incentives for first and second earners in the family. Understanding the complexity of the consequences involved in reforming family policy is crucial if the aim is to “kill two birds with one stone” namely to reduce poverty and improve incentives to work. In this brief, we illustrate these complex trade-offs by analyzing several scenarios of reforming financial support for families with children in Poland. We show that it is possible to create incentives for second earners in the family to join the labor force without destroying the work incentives of the first earners. Moreover, the same reform would allocate resources to families with lower incomes, which could result in a direct reduction of child poverty.", ,,"

Retrospective data from the SHARELIFE survey conducted in 2008/09 is used to reconstruct labour market experiences across the threshold of the socio-economic transformation from a centrally planned to a free market economy in Poland in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These individual experiences are matched with outcomes observed in the survey about twenty years later to examine their correlation with unemployment at the time of the transition. We find that becoming unemployed in the early 1990s correlates significantly with income, assets and a number of measures of wellbeing recorded in 2007 and 2012. Given the nature of labour market changes at the time of the transition, and an extensive set of controls we use in the estimation, we argue that the results can be given a causal interpretation. Losing a job between 1989-91 results in a reduction of total household income two decades later by over 30%, increases the probability of poor material conditions by 14 percentage points and has significant negative effects on overall life satisfaction and other measures of wellbeing.", ,,"

21,Alternative tax-benefit strategies to support children in Poland,https://cenea.org.pl/2009/03/01/alternative-tax-benefit-strategies-to-support-children-in-poland/,"Eurostat data shows that children and elderly are especially at risk of being in poverty. In 2004 the average rates of poverty risk in the European Union for these groups were about 19%. In Poland, the rate was 29% for children and only 7% for the elderly. We examine the role of the tax-benefit system in explaining this situation and analyse how much child poverty figures could change under several reform scenarios. In 2005, families with children were mainly supported by a means-tested family allowance and some supplements. This was extended in 2007 with the introduction of a non-refundable child tax credit. Making use of the European tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD, this paper assesses the consequences of the recent reform in Poland. We examine the outcome in comparison to child policies in three other European systems and show that poverty reduction would have been more pronounced, if child policies were changed along the lines of the system in France or the United Kingdom. The Austrian system – relying primarily on universal benefits – would bring about a similar reduction in the poverty rate but with much greater reduction in the poverty gap. The paper presents detailed distributional analysis under the different systems assuming the cost of “importing” each of them to be the same as that of introducing the 2007 reform.", ,,"

Using the examples of Germany and Poland, two neighbouring countries which have generally dealt relatively well with the outbreak in recent months, we show that there is significant regional variation both in the distribution of health status and healthcare resources. Highly differentiated demographic and epidemiological risks related to the pandemic between as well as within Germany and Poland call for a decentralised evaluation of risks and point out the need to consider an application of regionally focused policy reactions such as lockdowns and social distancing regulations. The cross-country regional perspective adds a valuable angle to the analysis of challenges raised by the Covid-19 pandemic and should urgently be considered regarding any possible consequences of future outbreaks of the virus.", ,,"

While of course different in many ways, the changes that accompanied the transition affected society as a whole, but also had heterogenous effects across different groups. One particular dimension – also discussed in relation to the current COVID-19 crises – is that of relative costs and benefits for men and women respectively. In this brief we re-examine one specific element of this, namely the developments of gender gaps in the labour market and social norms related to labour market activity over time and across countries, starting in the years before transition.Similarly to the current economic crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the socio-economic developments of the post-transition period left women in Poland in a less favourable economic position relative to men. Here we discuss two main sources of gender inequalities in the context of the Polish labour market –  the gender gap in employment and pay. Though a certain improvement in this regard can be observed over the last 30 years, significant inequalities between women and men remain today and may have substantial impact in the future, especially for differences in poverty risk in old age. ", ,,"

Recently, however, we have witnessed policymakers and international institutions increasingly pay attention to better understand material and social distress and to identify the means to improve a broadly defined standard of living. In this brief, we summarize some of the results and conclusions from a recently published First Results Book based on the latest data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We discuss the approach adopted to measure material and social deprivation, and the subsequent identification of risk of social exclusion. We show that Europeans increasingly value the quality of their social life as they grow older and that factors, such as worsening health, unmet long-term care needs, loneliness or lack of social cohesion are important determinants of social exclusion among the 50+ population. If socio-economic policies are to respond effectively to the needs of older Europeans, then broader aspects of their lives need to be taken into account and public policy should go beyond simple targets of income-defined poverty.", ,,"

We show that the combination of wage growth and progressivity of the tax system determined the fiscal leeway which governments could use to reduce income inequality. Despite significantly faster wage growth in the examined post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe, their much lower degree of progressivity implied limited additional scope for fiscal changes. While decisions taken in most of the examined countries in the CEE region led to increases in tax progressivity, their income tax systems continue to be far less redistributive in comparison with such countries as Ireland, the Netherlands, or Portugal. This not only has direct implications for income inequality but also translates into limitations of automatic fiscal drag effects on government revenues, which could offer additional resources, in particular at a time of high inflation.

Using 12 years of data from the German Socio-Economic Panel we study the nature of the relationship between poor health and non-employment on a sample of German men aged 30–59. We propose a joint model of health and labor market risks which identifies the mechanism through which poor health contributes to the probability of being jobless and vice versa. We find an important role of unobserved heterogeneity and evidence for correlation in the unobservable characteristics determining the two processes. The results also show strong persistence in the dynamics of health and labor market risks.", ,,"

Information contained in data on households incomes usually enable calculation only total “real” income. Microsimulation models with calculated “theoretical” and “hypothetical” incomes enable inter alia estimation of changes in households incomes caused by made or planned reforms of tax-benefit instruments. In the article tax-benefit model for Poland using data obtained from the households budget survey 2003 was presented and the model quality trough the comparison of simu­lation results with the available administrative data was evaluated. Presented model quality evaluation shows that SIMPL model is not far different from other European tax–benefit models as far as quality results are concerned.

These consisted of reductions in the disability rate of Social Security Contributions (SSCs) and an introduction of an income tax credit for families with children. We show that the SSCs reforms on their own brought much greater reductions in the tax burden compared to a widely discussed 15% “flat tax”, despite a very similar simulated cost. When considered together the package of introduced reforms reduced the mean ATR on total labour cost from 41.6% to 35.7%. This compares to the mean ATR of 39.6% which would result from the introduction of the “flat tax”. In the analysis we present the effects of the reforms both for the employed and for the non-employed populations. The latter analysis is done in such a way as to account for the entire (simulated) distribution of wages of the non-employed and shows interesting differences between the effects of reforms on employed and non-employed individuals. We argue that to fully appreciate the effect of reductions in labour taxation it is important to bear in mind that one of the reasons for introducing them is to make employment more likely for those who currently do not work, and demonstrate that the introduced package has had a particularly important effect on non-employed second earners. Given the extent of the reductions in the “klin” it is somewhat surprising that so far so little attention has been given to the recent Polish reforms.", ,,"

Taking advantage of the microsimulation model SIMPL we demonstrate that the entire package of reforms increased household incomes by from 1.7% to 2.2% of the GDP depending on the assumed incidence of reductions of employers’ social security contributions. With legislated incidence of SSCs incomes of 8.2% of households grew by more than 10%. Assigning entire reductions in employers’ SSCs to employees, incomes of as many as 16.7% of households grow by at least 10% as a result of the changes. At the same time however, about 8% of households experienced falling incomes, mainly as a result of freezing of the nominal parameter values of the tax and benefit system. We demonstrate that the proportional gains over the period have been distributed fairly equally by decile groups. The package of reforms introduced from 2006-2011 increased the value of the Gini coefficient by 0,46 percentage points.", ,,"

Using the 1997–2003 Polish Household Budget Surveys, we begin by estimating “difference-in-differences” regressions, where we compare household saving and expenditure across time and between cohorts affected and unaffected by the reform. Next, we estimate the extent of crowd-out by using two-stage least squares. We identify the effect of pension wealth on private saving by using the cohort-by-time variation in pension wealth that is explained by the reform. We find that one additional Polish zloty, or PLN, of pension wealth crowds out about 0.24 PLN in household saving. We also find heterogeneity in responses. For the middle-aged cohorts, we find a large public pension crowd-out of private saving (about 0.54 PLN of private saving for each 1 PLN of public pension wealth), while the crowd-out for younger cohorts equals about 0.30 PLN of private saving per 1 PLN. Finally, we find a close-to-complete crowd-out among highly-educated households.", ,,"

34,Securing Women’s Safety at the Time of War,https://cenea.org.pl/2022/03/08/securing-womens-safety-at-the-time-of-war/,"The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation sets a tragic background for this year’s International Women’s Day. The war has resulted in the loss of human life as well as suffering and displacement of hundreds of thousands of individuals. By March 6th 2022 over 1,5 million people fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries, while Russian forces have indiscriminately targeted Ukrainian towns and cities and failed to establish safety corridors for the civilian population and for humanitarian support. There exists extensive evidence that military conflicts put women at particular risk. This is the case both at the site of direct military confrontation, as well as a consequence of vulnerabilities generated by the need to flee their home. While one is clearly most concerned about the most direct expressions of gender-based violence, such as rape, sexual abuse or beating, we should also bear in mind that gender-based violence often takes the form of non-physical mistreatment, psychological pressure, or limitations on individual freedoms and displacement (Wirtz et al, 2014).Indeed, the use of sexual violence during armed conflicts is by now broadly understood as a premeditated and deliberate technology of war, rather than the brutal expression of some base instinct triggered by the stress of conflict situations (Skjelsbaek, 2001), and there is evidence that aggressors from societies that are more gender-unequal are more likely to use it (Taylor, 1999; Meger, 2016, Guarnieri and Tur-Prats, 2020). Also, after fleeing conflict zones the spectre of sexual and gender-based violence follows displaced populations: the risk for sexual violence is heightened in refugee camps (Araujo et al, 2019). Further, it has been shown that rates of intimate partner violence during complex emergencies are much higher than rates of wartime sexual violence perpetrated outside of homes (Stark and Ager, 2011), and that domestic violence may be exacerbated by conflict and displacement (Wirtz et al, 2014).Thus, the international community, the governments of countries which welcome families escaping the war, and the countless organised and improvised support groups, ought to pay particular attention to the risks to the welfare of women at this extraordinary time.All agencies involved in assisting the Ukrainian population, both within and outside its borders, should be particularly aware of broad aspects of gender-based violence which the international academic community has been stressing for Securing women’s safety at the time of war the last few decades. As the war continues the international community, the governments of the host countries, and the European Union ought to ensure that:● Women and vulnerable groups that want or need to leave conflict zones are allowed to do so in a safe way.● All perpetrators of violence, including sexual violence, are eventually brought to justice. For this, there should be no question of impunity. For this to be possible safe spaces, infrastructure and reporting practices need to be established and enforced.● As per UN Security Council Resolution 1820 (first applied to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2008) sexual violence ought to be used as part of the designation criteria in sanctions regimes. This implies that “targeted and graduated” measures can be imposed against warring factions who commit rape and other forms of violence against women and girls.● Refugee women are involved in the design, management or leadership of gender-based violence protection measures in refugee camps, if such were to be established (UNHCR, 2011)● Training programmes concerning gender-based violence, including sexual violence, and available legal mechanisms to prevent it are provided for volunteers, staff and refugees to minimize the risk for fleeing women (Spangaro et al 2013).● In the medium and longer term, in case of an inability to return to their homes, host countries facilitate legal work among refugees to avoid a cycle of vulnerability that may lead displaced women to seek precarious means of earning income (Ray et al. 2009).● Social support through individual or group therapy and skilled support groups is offered to reduce mental distress (Willman, 2013).As we await the peaceful end of the invasion of Ukraine and the safe return of hundreds of thousands of families to their homes, may this year’s International Women’s Day be a day of reflection and resolution on appropriate means and strategies to prevent and combat sexual and gender-based violence, both on the scene of the the armed conflict as well as against all women who find refuge from the war in foreign countries.On March 7th 2022 the FREE Network was planning to host a conference on “Economic and social context of domestic violence” as part of the Forum for Research on Gender Economics (FROGEE). The conference has been postponed until representatives of all the FREE Network institutes can safely participate.

We find that poverty defined with respect to relative incomes has no effect on changes in health. However, broader measures of poor material conditions such as subjective poverty or low relative value of wealth significantly increase the probability of transition to poor health among the healthy and reduce the chance of recovery from poor health over the time interval analysed. In addition to this the subjective measure of poverty has a significant effect on mortality, increasing it by 40.3% among men and by 58.3% among those aged 50–64. Material conditions matter for health among older people. We suggest that if monitoring of poverty in old age and corresponding policy targets are to focus on the relevant measures, they should take into account broader definitions of poverty than those based only on relative incomes.", ,,"

In terms of most analysed outcomes we find a \”West-East gradient\” with the most favourable statistics found for the west German population and the worst for Poland. The unfavourable situation on the labour market in Poland goes along poor health and lifestyle outcomes on most measures, and it seems that employment and health-related policies should be designed in combination to address the problems. The East–West divide in Germany still seems to present a policy challenge. We find important differences in such outcomes as labour market arrangements and such health outcomes as incidence of high blood pressure and diabetes. The East–West gradient is also found in the so-called underused capacity, i.e. the proportion of healthy individuals aged 50–65 who are not employed. The main factor behind this in Poland is retirement, while the difference in Germany is largely caused by higher levels of unemployment in the east.", ,,"

We confirm this in a simulation of an in‐work support system introduced into the German tax and benefit system. Our simulation results suggest that introducing in‐work tax credits in Germany would increase the employment of single individuals by over 105,000 but would result in a reduction of labour supply among individuals living in couples by about 70,000, among both women and men. The result found for men is especially important as it is markedly different from all results for the UK, where the net response among men has always been found to be positive. Our estimation results call for a high degree of caution as far as ‘importing’ UK‐style tax credits to Germany is concerned. In‐work support based on family income would reinforce the existing work disincentives for secondary earners, reducing the employment levels of both men and women living in couples.", ,,"

The reform introduced universal regular payments of 500 PLN per month for each second and subsequent child in the family aged 0-17, supplemented with means-tested 500 PLN per month for the first child in low income households. As such, the programme significantly changed the balance of financial incentives to work among parents. We estimate that it will reduce labour supply among families with children by about 240,000 individuals, principally mothers in families with one or two children. The estimates suggest that labour supply effects will be felt most strongly in small towns and villages and will contribute substantially to the reduction of the proportion of couples in which both partners are working.", ,,"

Fiscal reforms implemented during this period are analysed from the point of view of the changing distributional implications of the tax and benefit system. Finally, we decompose changes in inequality of disposable incomes to identify the role of tax and benefit policies and separate it from other factors affecting incomes at the time. We find that 44% of the 0.7pp reduction in the Gini coefficient between 2005-2014 can be associated with tax and benefit reforms.", ,,"

The core focus is on the teacher quality and its interaction with Swedish institutional setup, which closely resembles what economists usually argue for. In addition to standard quality measures I use a unique dataset containing the population-wide information on cognitive and non-cognitive assessments of males born 1951 or later. The results do not support the common view that schools, in particular these serving disadvantaged students, experience higher turnover of high quality teachers. In fact, both high cognitive and non-cognitive skills teachers are less likely to change employers. The estimates also suggest that teacher mobility decisions can be influenced through changes in monetary compensations and type of employment. Finally, high skilled teachers do not leave the profession, which suggests that the drop in teacher quality should be ascribed to the quality of new entrants.", ,,"

While initially designed as an instrument to target low income working families, the credit was implemented as a tax credit without any upper earnings limit, and its generosity was substantially extended in autumn 2007 implying an annual cost of about 0.5% of the Polish GDP. The current design grants highest gains in absolute terms to families in the upper half of the income distribution, while proportionally gains are most significant for those in the middle of the distribution. Households with children in the bottom decile of the income distribution gain on average about 7.60PLN per month, and those in the top 40% of the distribution gain over a hundred zloty per month on average. The paper also considers effects of potential reforms of the CTC aimed at reducing its cost. The recently discussed eligibility limitation to families with three or more children, would reduce the cost of the policy by between 80% and 90%, while a simulated reduction of generosity of the credit by 50%, would save the government about 2.2bn PLN per year. The latter policy would leave the incomes of families with children in the bottom deciles largely unchanged, and it would reduce the benefits from the credit to households in the upper half of the income distribution by about 50% on average.", ,,"

Considering the widespread consensus among experts about the efficacy of vaccines in preventing hospitalisation and death resulting from the virus, low vaccination rates and widespread anti-vaccine sentiments in Poland are of great concern. We use data from the DIAGNOZA+ Survey to demonstrate the relationship between various demographic characteristics, opinions around certain gender norms, the propensity for conspiratorial thinking, concern about the pandemic, and vaccine scepticism. While controlling for exogenous demographic characteristics, we measure the strength of the relationship between various beliefs that people hold and how they feel about the COVID-19 vaccine. Our analysis indicates that while respondents who hold more traditional views on gender roles are 6 percentage points less likely to get vaccinated, those who agree with a variety of conspiratorial statements are 43 percentage points less likely to vaccinate against COVID-19.", ,,"

Yet if economies experience a high degree of (non‐random) fluctuation in employment, the composition of the employed population will have a considerable effect on the computed average. In this paper we demonstrate the extent of this problem using data for Poland for the period 1996–2003. During these years the employment rate in Poland fell from 51.2 percent to 44.2 percent and most of this fall occurred between the end of 1998 and the end of 2002. We show that about a quarter of the growth in the average wage during this period could be attributed purely to changes in employment.", ,,"

Though issues regarding VAT rates or tax settlement mechanisms are brought into the public debate in Poland on a regular basis, little is still known on the distribution of the VAT burden among Polish households. In this brief, we analyze the VAT relation to household income, consumption and demographic structure in Poland. We find that the VAT burden is inversely related to income, with the bottom ten percent of the population paying on average 16.3% of their income in VAT and the top income group paying only 6.8%. Larger households, such as those with children, pay about 11%-15% more VAT due to higher spending. However, as a result of different spending structures, the additional VAT burden of families with children is independent of the number of children and only marginally dependent on their age. These differences in the tax burden should be taken into consideration in the current debate on the possibility of unifying the VAT rates in Poland.", ,,"

Having a first-born daughter as compared with a first-born son increases the level of household expenditures on child and adult female clothing, and it reduces spending on games, toys and hobbies. This could be a reflection of a pure gender bias on behalf of the parents or a reflection of gender complementarities between parents’ and children’s expenditures. We find no robust evidence on gender differences in educational investment, measured by kindergarten expenditure. The analysed expenditure patterns suggest a so-far unexamined role of gender in child development. Parents in Poland seem to pay more attention to how girls look and favour boys with respect to activities and play, which could have consequences in adult life and contribute to sustaining gender inequalities and stereotypes.", ,,"

In this brief, we draw on two recent pre-election reports published by the Centre for Economic Analysis, CenEA. We discuss developments in tax and benefit policies under the coalition of the Civic Platform and the Polish People’s Party over the last eight years, as well as the pre-election pledges regarding tax and benefit policies to be implemented after the elections. We show a significant shift in policy priorities with respect to the distributional effect of the tax-benefit policies between the first (2007- 2011) and the second (2011-2015) term in office, towards more support for low-income families. We also argue that, judging by the presented electoral pledges, Polish voters face a difficult choice between the promises of the opposition parties, which seem too costly to be realistic, and an enigmatic tax overhaul reform proposed by the governing Civic Platform, which is supposed to substantially benefit nearly all working households at a low cost for the state budget, with details of the reform design, however, kept away from public scrutiny.", ,,"

For this purpose we focus on policy reforms implemented in Poland between 2005 and 2011 which included a number of significant changes in the tax and benefit system. While marginal and participation tax rates in the majority of analyzed cases fall as a result of the reforms, the conclusions from looking at replacement rates for the population eligible for means tested benefits are generally different. These suggest that despite significant tax giveaways incentives on the labor market weakened as a result of the reform package for families with children and for those eligible to safety net benefits. For the majority of analyzed scenarios work incentives improved over the years despite the negative effect of the reforms only due to significant real wage growth. For a significant number of analyzed cases we find conflicting conclusions on the effect of reforms on financial incentives to work using the PTRs and RRs. Given the different nature of these measures this is not necessarily surprising, but serves as a note of caution on the use of each of them independently, in particular with reference to complex reform packages.", ,,"

The dispute on the sources of altruism refers usually to sociobiology and genetic improvement, even though there are also arguments for another mechanism in operation based rather upon social than biological relations. The changes in family formation, tenure and structure that took place over the previous century might have affected signicantly the relations within family. In addition to these processes Europe is facing opportunities and threats coming from ageing which makes mechanisms determining intergenerational interactions especially relevant. For these reasons the hypothesis on kinship altruism’s presence within families shall be investigated in more detail. We found evidence over the sample of 50+ population in Europe showing that there is no reason to believe that parents over 49 treat the biological childrenn in a different way than non-biological children as far as the intervivos transfers are concerned. However, children among which there is a non-biological one are less likely to provide financial and non-financial transfers to parents.", ,,"

We find that the top-corrected Gini coefficient grew by 14-26% more compared to the unadjusted survey-based estimates. This implies that over the last three decades Poland has become one of the most unequal European countries among those for which top-corrected inequality estimates exist.

While demographic re-weighting is neutral from the point of view of income distribution, calibrating the grossing-up weights to adjust for economic status and tax identifiers significantly increases income inequality.

On-the-job persecution is found to have significant effect on job quality assessment and is strongly related to reporting of distinct periods of stress in both countries. Consequences of on-the-job persecution seem to have been much more severe and longer lasting in the Czech Republic, with significant financial effects of job loss or discrimination.

Still, it is possible to analyze the direct implications of the lockdown, self-isolation and quarantine measures introduced over the last few weeks in an attempt to formulate a preliminary assessment of how the outbreak will affect households in economic terms. The priority challenge now is, of course, to contain the spread of coronavirus, but as we identify the scale of potential economic consequences associated with the pandemic, we may help calibrate the safeguards that could protect households from the impact of the imminent economic slowdown.In this commentary paper, based on the Household Budget Survey (HBS) data, the percentage of households (HHs) whose members are most at risk of losing their job or compromising their income due to the first wave of economic consequences of the pandemic is taken as a measure of economic impact of COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis looks into the population of people who are economically active (through employment or self-employment) in those sectors of the economy which are most exposed to the effects of the lockdown. According to our findings, 17.2 percent of the HHs in Poland are at risk of a loss of income due to the first wave of economic consequences of the pandemic, and for 5.2 percent of the HHs this risk can be described as particularly high. When we focus on the HHs with at least one person active on the labor market, the parameters are 24.7 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively.The full report is available ", ,,"

We propose to model poor health and non-employment as interrelated risks determined within a dynamic structure conditional on a set of individual characteristics. Applying dynamic panel estimation we identify the mechanism through which poor health contributes to the probability of being jobless and vice versa. We find an important role of unobserved heterogeneity and evidence for correlation in the unobservable characteristics determining the two processes.

Health and flexibility of hours of work,https://cenea.org.pl/2010/01/01/poorer-health-shorter-hours-health-and-flexibility-of-hours-of-work/,"We analyse the role of health in determining the difference between desired and actual hours of work in a sample of German men using the Socio-Economic Panel Data for years 1996-2007. The effects of both self-assessed health and legal disability status are examined. About 60% of employees report working more than they would wish with the mean difference of -3.9 hours/week. We estimate static and dynamic model specifications allowing for auto-regressive nature of the dependent variable and testing for the role of lagged health status. Important differences are found between east and west German Laender. In the west we confirm serial dependence in the disequilibrium and find statistically significant role of general health measures in determining the disequilibrium. Employees in bad health want to work on average by about 0.4 hour/week less according to the static specification, and by about 1 hour/week less if dynamics of health and of the disequilibrium are taken into account. This is respectively 10% and 25% of the mean difference. We find no effects of legal disability status on the disequilibrium which we interpret as a reflection of stronger legal position of disabled employees.", ,,"

We use high-quality satellite night-time light intensity data as an innovative, comparable and reliable measure to proxy for economic activity on both sides of the border consistently over a long period of time (1992-2012). We use descriptive heat maps as well as regression analysis to investigate two aspects: first, how far is the economic convergence across and within municipalities along the Polish-German border? Second, what effect does the distance to the border have on economic activity as measured with light emissions? Our findings suggest that – somewhat surprisingly – convergence across the border has been almost complete. Polish towns that used to be economically much weaker have caught up with German towns. Also, we show that the patterns of economic activity related to distance vary greatly for Germany and Poland.", ,,"

The unique Swedish institutional setup with a growing private sector and individually negotiated wages is ideal to analyze teacher turnover in an environment that economists typically argue for. I find statistically significant and robust negative correlations between mobility and earnings as well as wages. Unlike in the previous research, I do not find robust evidence that share of minorities raise turnover, however, upper secondary and private school teachers are significantly affected. Importantly though, even the discouraged teachers rather change schools than leave teaching. Furthermore, the private sector experiences higher teacher turnover and these institutions have particular problems with retaining science teachers and employing full time faculty.", ,,"

78,Five Years in Operation: the Polish Universal Child Benefit,https://cenea.org.pl/2021/03/31/swiadczenie-wychowawcze-po-pieciu-latach-500-plus-ile/,"Over the last five years, Polish families with children have been entitled to a relatively generous benefit of approximately €110 per month and child. Initially granted for every second and subsequent child in the family regardless of income and for the first child for low-income families, the benefit was made fully universal in 2019. With the total costs amounting to as much as 1.7% of Poland’s GDP, the benefit reaches the parents of 6.7 million children and significantly affects these families’ position in the income distribution. Its introduction has led to a substantial reduction in the number of children living in poverty. However, since families with children are more likely to be among households in the upper half of the income distribution, out of the total cost of the benefit, a proportionally greater share ends up in the wallets of high-income families. While the implementation of the benefit has significantly changed the scope of public support to families in Poland, there are many lessons to be learnt and some important revisions to be undertaken to achieve an effective and comprehensive support system.", ,,"

We focus on one of the most often quoted mechanisms which could be responsible for the positive effects of homeownership, namely its role in providing material security in old age. Using data from 15 European countries collected in wave 2 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we analyse the relationship between homeownership and material security, as measured through subjective expectations of being better or worse off in the future. We find that homeowners have a higher level of material security than renters, and this association is especially strong for those living in big cities. For this subsample, in comparison to renters, owning a property in the top quartile of the home value distribution is associated with an increase in the probability of expecting to be better off in the future by as much as 43%. With respect to our measure of material security we find no such correlations with education, income or financial assets. We interpret the results as support for the argument that homeownership offers a very particular form of material security, which may be behind its positivse implications for well-being.", ,,"

80,Making work pay: increasing labour supply of secondary earners in low income families with children in Poland.,https://cenea.org.pl/2015/02/01/making-work-pay-increasing-labour-supply-of-secondary-earners-in-low-income-families-with-children-in-poland/,In-work support through the tax-benefit system has proved to be an effective way of increasing labour supply of lone mothers and first earners in couples in a number of OECD countries. At the same time these instruments usually create negative employment incentives for secondary earners. This in turn reduces the potential of in-work support to address the joint objectives of higher employment and lower poverty levels. In this paper we examine labour supply implications of a diverse set of possible reforms to the main elements of tax and benefit support of families with children in Poland. We show how an adequate combination of increased generosity of the tax and benefit system with the introduction of a “double earner” premium may result in increased labour supply of first and second earners in couples and concentrate the response in the lower half of the income distribution thus increasing the potential of in-work support to alleviate poverty., ,,"

81,Why are there fewer women than men in politics?,https://cenea.org.pl/2021/03/03/dlaczego-w-polityce-jest-mniej-kobiet-niz-mezczyzn/,"All over the world, there are far fewer women than men in political positions, and the disproportion is particularly visible in the case of senior positions. In Poland, in the initial years of transition, the participation of women in politics was very limited, and for many years Poland has performed quite poorly in the ranking of European countries based on general equality indicators, and in particular the position of women in politics. In 2011, the Polish government took steps to reduce the disproportion in women’s political participation by introducing proportional quotas on electoral lists. However, despite the increase in the proportion of female candidates on these lists and despite the increase in the number of female deputies in the Sejm, the number of women in Parliament still remains significantly lower than the number of men. In part, this is probably due to the conservative views or even prejudices of voters themselves. However, a significant role is also played by prejudices within political parties, whose leaders do not place women in top positions on electoral lists. It seems, therefore, that the introduction of gender quotas alone is not enough to overcome the barriers faced by women in the electoral process and further, more comprehensive changes in the law may be necessary.The full Report is available Reports from Belarus, Georgia, Latvia, Ukraine and Russia are available in English and the national languages ", ,,"

While initially designed as an instrument addressed to low income working families, the tax credit was implemented without any upper earnings limit, and its generosity was substantially extended in 2007 implying an annual budgetary cost of about 0.5% of the GDP. The current design of the credit grants largest income gains in absolute terms to families in the upper half of the income distribution, while proportional gains are most significant for those in the middle of the income distribution. Households with children in the bottom 10% of the income distribution gain on average about 7.60 PLN per month, and those in the top 40% gain over a 100 PLN per month on average. The paper also analyses the possible effects of potential reforms of the CTC aimed at reducing its cost. The recently proposed eligibility limitation to families with three or more children would reduce the fiscal cost of the tax credit by 80-90%, while a simulated reduction of generosity of the credit by 50% would save in the state budget about 2.2 bn PLN per year. The latter policy would leave the incomes of families with children in the lowest deciles largely unchanged, and it would reduce the benefits from the credit to households in the upper half of the income distribution by about 50% on average.", ,,"

We examine the extent to which the cross-country differences in the level of physical activity can be explained by differences in other characteristics such as education, residence and health, and to what extent the differences between countries – and the observed low levels of physical activity in Poland – relate to unobserved characteristics and could thus be referred to as differences in “activity habits”. We show that even controlling for a number of exogenous characteristics the Polish 50+ population is among the least active in Europe. Only when controlled for life-style and health characteristics (which are likely to be endogenous to physical activity), the level of physical activity in Poland is similar to several other countries but even then is still significantly lower compared to Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and the Nordic countries.", ,,"

In this report, we present an analysis of the housing situation of people aged 65+ in Poland compared to other European countries, with our results indicating that there is a large diversity in health risks for the elderly. This is due, on the one hand, to differences in the rate of cohabitation with younger people, and on the other, to differences in the frequency of using care institutions in later life. One of the basic challenges for both health and socio-economic policy design in the coming months will be to ensure safety and reduce coronavirus infection in the oldest population group. Decisions regarding the loosening of regulations that have imposed an obligation to maintain social distancing, in addition to considering incidence statistics, should also take these differences into account.The Commentary Paper is available ", ,,"

Apart from studying the effects of gender on family stability, fertility and mothers’ labor market outcomes, we take advantage of the PHBS’ detailed expenditure module to examine effects of gender on consumption patterns. We find that a first born daughter is significantly less likely to be living with her father compared to a first born son and that the probability of having the second child is negatively correlated with a first born daughter. Using the context of the collective model we provide interpretation of these results from the perspective of individual parental gender preferences. We also examine the potential effects of sample selection bias which may affect the results and may be important for other findings in the literature. Labor supply of mothers and overall child-related consumption is not affected by gender of the first child, but the pattern of expenditure significantly varies between those with first born sons and first born daughters. One possible interpretation of the findings is that Polish fathers have preferences for sons and Polish mothers have preferences for daughters. Expenditure patterns suggest potential early determination of gender roles – mommies’ girls get dresses and daddies’ boys get toys.", ,,"
